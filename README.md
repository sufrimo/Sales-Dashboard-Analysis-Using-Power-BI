# Sales-Dashboard-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
The project uses 12 Shopee Excel files stored in a folder. Power BIâ€™s Power Query loads and transforms the data by merging tables, adjusting formats, and creating calculated columns. The final data model supports interactive analysis with charts and filters, allowing users to explore sales by month, day, hour, region, and top products.
